Description
--------------- 

This simple and lightweight tool is to facilitate the quick and easy creation of platemaps from high-throughput experimentation (HTE). 
Once created, these platemaps can be used with [PyParse](https://github.com/thatchemistryguy/PyParse), a python script which takes the data from the platemap to analyse UPLC-MS data 
and generate user-friendly outputs, including a standardised, machine-readable table that contains all information about that plate. 

In conjunction with one another, PyParse_designer and PyParse form an end-to-end workflow of plate design, analysis of data, long-term capture of the 
information generated.

By using this workflow, datasets containing everything from the ID of the catalyst in a particular well, to the temperature of the plate, to the 
peak percentage area of product observed, are created.
